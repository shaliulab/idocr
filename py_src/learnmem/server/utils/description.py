class DescribedObject:
    r"""

    This is used to parse user option for the web interface.

    ``description`` is a dictionary with the fields "overview" and "arguments".
    "overview" is simply a string. "arguments" is a list of dictionaries. Each has the field:

     * name: The name of the argument as it is in "__init__"
     * description: "A user friendly description of the argument"
     * type: "number", "datetime", "daterange" and "string".
     * min, max and step: only for type "number",
       defines the accepted limits of the arguments
       as well as the increment in the user interface
     * default: the default value

    Each argument must match a argument in `__init__`.
